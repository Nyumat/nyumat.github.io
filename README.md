**This is my personal website, TEKN. Welcome to the Github repo for it.**

I was originally going to continue hosting it through Github pages with a custom domain, but I decided that since domains are so cheap nowadays, I might as well get one.

*And now here we are.*

# The Development Process...

It definitely isn't the most perfect thing in the world. It's Simple. But as a wise man once said:

Especially considering that the project page is completely outdated. And looking at my current resume basically gives it away. I'm glad that I got to work with HTML & CSS though. JavaScript code was not 100% written by me (Shoutout to GitHub user @ajlkn) Without him, a large part of functionality just would not  be possible.

Even without thinking about what would concur if I tried to re-write the legacy JavaScript code, I knew from the start there was no was it'd end well. When I first began development, I really only had the word Portfoilio stuck in my head and that's all I coded towards. Hence such a weird index for just 4 side-projects, but lol that's besides the point. 

This project took an INCREDIBLY long ammount of time, I'm really glad I get to show it off to anyone who views this readMe.

Have fun checking it out! My very own Custom Domain (nyumat.com) is coming very soon.
