**This is my personal website, TEKN. Welcome to the Github repo for it.**

I was originally going to continue hosting it through Github pages with a custom domain, but I decided that since domains are so cheap nowadays, I might as well get one.

*And here we are.*

# The Development Process.

It definitely isn't the most perfect thing in the world. It's Simple. But as a wise man once said:

Especially considering that the project page is completely outdated. And looking at my current resume basically gives it away. I'm glad that I got to work with HTML & CSS though. JS was not written by me (Shoutout to @ajlkn) Without him none of this would be possible.

Even thinking about what would concur if I tried to re-write the legacy JS code, I knew from the start there was no was it'd end well. When I first began development, I really only had the word Portfoilio stuck in my head and that's all I coded towards. Hence such a weird index for just 4 side-projects, lol.

### Have fun checking it out though. Custom Domain (nyumat.com) is coming soon.
